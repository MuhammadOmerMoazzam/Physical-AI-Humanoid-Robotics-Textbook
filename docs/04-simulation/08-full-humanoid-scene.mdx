# One-Click Launch (ships with this chapter)

```bash
# Terminal 1 – Isaac Sim
./isaac-sim.sh --/app/window/fullscreen=false assets/scenes/humanoid_isaac_sim/factory_scene.usd

# Terminal 2 – RL training
python3 train_walking_isaaclab.py --num-envs 512 --headless

# Terminal 3 – ROS 2 bridge
ros2 launch isaac_sim_ros2_bridge humanoid_fleet.launch.py num_robots:=100
```

Watch 500+ humanoids learn to walk, fall, get back up — all differently randomized.

**You now control the most powerful robotics simulation stack on Earth.**
