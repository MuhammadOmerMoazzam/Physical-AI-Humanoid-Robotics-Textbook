# Chapter 4: Physics Simulation – Gazebo & NVIDIA Isaac Sim

**Learning Objectives**
- Understand why Isaac Sim replaced Gazebo for 95 % of cutting-edge humanoid labs in 2025
- Master the full USD → PhysX → domain randomization pipeline
- Generate millions of synthetic trajectories with perfect labels
- Run 1000+ parallel humanoid environments at real-time on a single RTX 4090
- Deploy the exact same scene headless on cloud GPUs

> By the end, you will launch 500 randomized humanoids training to walk — in under 30 seconds.
