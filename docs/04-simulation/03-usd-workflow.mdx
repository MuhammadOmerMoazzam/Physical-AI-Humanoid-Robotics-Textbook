# From URDF → USD in One Command

```bash
# Already done for you
urdf2usd assets/models/humanoid_g1/urdf/g1.urdf.xacro \
         assets/scenes/humanoid_isaac_sim/humanoid_g1.usd \
         --output-physics --fix-materials
```

Now drag `humanoid_g1.usd` into any Isaac Sim scene → instant:
- Correct articulation tree
- PhysX rigid bodies + joints
- Collision shapes
- Inertial parameters

**No more manual rigging. Ever.**
