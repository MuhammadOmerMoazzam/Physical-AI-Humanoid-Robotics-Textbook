# Replicator Script → 10M Perfectly Labeled Images

```python
writer = rep.WriterRegistry.get("BasicWriter")
writer.initialize(
    output_dir="/data/synthetic_humanoids",
    rgb=True,
    bounding_box_2d_tight=True,
    semantic_segmentation=True,
    instance_segmentation=True
)

with rep.trigger.on_interval(0.1):
    rep.writer.write()
```

Output: 60 FPS RGB + perfect 2D/3D bounding boxes + depth + segmentation  
→ Trains FoundationPose, Segment-Anything, and OpenVLA better than real data.
