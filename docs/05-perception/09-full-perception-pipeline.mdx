# One-Click Bringup (Real or Simulated)

```bash
# Real hardware (Jetson)
ros2 launch perception_pipeline perception_bringup.launch.py use_sim:=false

# Simulation (Isaac Sim + synthetic RealSense)
ros2 launch perception_pipeline perception_bringup.launch.py use_sim:=true
```

- Live 3D map with loop closure
- Tracked humans (bounding boxes + skeletons)
- 6D poses of arbitrary objects
- Robot pose with covariance
- Fake laser scan for Nav2
