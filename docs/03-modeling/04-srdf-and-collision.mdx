# SRDF: The File That Makes MoveIt Fast

```xml
<!-- Disable adjacent body collisions -->
<disable_collisions link1="left_upper_arm" link2="torso" reason="adjacent"/>
<disable_collisions link1="right_upper_arm" link2="torso" reason="adjacent"/>
```

**2025 best practice:** Use `moveit_setup_assistant` → export → commit the generated SRDF. Never hand-write collision rules for >20 DoF.
