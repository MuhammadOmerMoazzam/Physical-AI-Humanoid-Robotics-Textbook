# Example: Walk + Wave (2025 SOTA)

```python
from moveit_msgs.msg import Constraints, JointConstraint, PositionConstraint

# Goal: right hand at [1.0, -0.3, 1.2], pelvis stays near origin
goal = PlanningOptions()
goal.planning_scene_diff.robot_state.is_diff = True

# High-priority: keep pelvis near start
pos_const = PositionConstraint()
pos_const.link_name = "pelvis"
pos_const.target_point_offset.x = 0.1  # tolerance
```

2025: Use **Task Space Regions (TSR)** + **CHOMP** → smooth human-like motion.
