# The Embodiment Paradox

> "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility."  
> — Hans Moravec, 1988 [1]

For thirty-five years, this observation defined robotics.

| Year | Abstract AI Milestone                     | Physical AI Reality                          |
|------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1997 | Deep Blue beats Kasparov                  | Robots still fall over on flat floors        |
| 2016 | AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol                   | Boston Dynamics Atlas does backflips… once   |
| 2022 | ChatGPT writes essays                     | Most labs still hand-code walking controllers|

Then, between Q2 2023 and Q4 2025, the paradox **inverted**.
