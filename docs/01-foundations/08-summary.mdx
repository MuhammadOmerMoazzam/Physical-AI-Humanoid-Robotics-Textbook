# Chapter Summary

2025 is not the year humanoids became perfect.  
It is the year they became **inevitable**.

The combination of:
- Foundation-model-scale data
- Sub-$20k hardware
- Simulation engines that actually transfer

…has ended the 35-year winter of embodied intelligence.

### Discussion Questions
1. Which of the three data engines will be the biggest bottleneck by 2030?
2. Will specialized robots (arms, quadrupeds) outcompete humanoids in certain industries?
3. Is the humanoid form factor a local maximum or the global optimum?
4. Should we regulate general-purpose humanoids the same way we regulate LLMs?
5. Name one technical capability you believe is still 5+ years away.
