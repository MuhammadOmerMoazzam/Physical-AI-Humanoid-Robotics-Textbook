# Chapter 7: Dexterous Manipulation & Grasp Synthesis

**Learning Objectives**
- Model 16–24 DoF anthropomorphic hands with correct tendon routing
- Simulate contact-rich interaction at 4 kHz using Isaac Lab
- Train and deploy diffusion policies that grasp unseen objects on first try
- Run Octo and RDT-1B locally — the two models that destroyed classical grasping
- Perform in-hand reorientation of arbitrary objects (pens, tools, bottles)

> By the end, your humanoid will pick, regrasp, and use objects as naturally as a 5-year-old child.
