# Complete Working Package

```bash
colcon build --packages-select ros2_humanoid_template
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ros2_humanoid_template spawn_humanoid.launch.py robot:=g1
```

You now have:
- Real-time joint control
- Safety watchdog
- RViz + Foxglove visualization
- One-click switch between Isaac Sim and real Unitree G1

**Full source:** `src/ros2_humanoid_template/` (already in this repo)

**Congratulations** — you just graduated from "ROS 2 user" to "humanoid robotics engineer."
