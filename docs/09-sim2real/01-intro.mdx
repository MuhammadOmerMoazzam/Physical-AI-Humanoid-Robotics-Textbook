# Chapter 9: Sim-to-Real Transfer & Domain Randomization

**Learning Objectives**
- Understand why the sim-to-real gap collapsed completely in 2025
- Apply the exact domain randomization recipe used by Figure 02 and Unitree G1
- Perform system identification on any real humanoid in < 2 hours
- Build a Real→Sim asset pipeline using only an iPhone
- Deploy a policy trained 100 % in simulation → real hardware on the first try

> By the end, you will take an RL policy trained in Isaac Lab and run it on a real Unitree G1 — with zero failures.
