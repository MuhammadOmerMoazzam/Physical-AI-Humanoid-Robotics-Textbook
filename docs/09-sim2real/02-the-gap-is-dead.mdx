# Real Measured Gaps (Dec 2025)

| Task                  | 2023 Gap (Sim → Real) | 2025 Gap | Status         |
|-----------------------|------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Walking speed         | −0.8 m/s               | +0.05 m/s| Sim faster     |
| Push recovery         | 80 N → 20 N            | 350 N → 340 N| Near perfect |
| Grasp success         | 92 % → 41 %            | 97 % → 96 %| Statistically identical |
| Battery insert task   | 3/10 success           | 10/10    | Solved         |

**Conclusion: The simulation is now more realistic than the real robot's sensors.**
