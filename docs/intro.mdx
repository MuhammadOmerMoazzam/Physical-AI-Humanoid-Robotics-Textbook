# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, the definitive open textbook for 2025. This comprehensive resource covers the latest developments in humanoid robotics research and development, from foundational concepts to cutting-edge applications.

## Overview of the Four Modules

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules, each building on the previous to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

### Module 1 – Foundations & Infrastructure
This module establishes the foundation for working with humanoid robots. You'll learn about:

- Hardware platforms and their capabilities
- Development environments using Docker and DevContainers
- Setting up ROS 2 and Isaac Sim
- Basic robot modeling and kinematics
- Introduction to control systems

Upon completing this module, you'll have a fully configured development environment ready for advanced robotics work.

### Module 2 – Simulation & Perception
Simulation is a cornerstone of efficient humanoid robot development. In this module, you'll explore:

- Advanced simulation techniques with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab
- Domain randomization for robust policy development
- 3D scene reconstruction and sensor modeling
- Perception systems including object detection and tracking
- Synthetic data generation pipelines
- Physics simulation and benchmarking

This module prepares you to create realistic simulation environments that accelerate robot development.

### Module 3 – Locomotion & Dexterous Manipulation
The core capabilities of humanoid robots lie in their movement and interaction. This module covers:

- Bipedal locomotion algorithms and control systems
- Convex Model Predictive Control (MPC) for walking
- Whole-body motion planning and control
- Dexterous manipulation techniques
- Grasp synthesis and in-hand reorientation
- Contact modeling and force control

You'll learn to implement both stable walking and precise manipulation skills.

### Module 4 – Intelligence, Transfer & Responsibility
The future of humanoid robotics depends on advanced AI and responsible deployment. This module includes:

- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models like OpenVLA and Octo
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques
- System identification and latency compensation
- Safety systems and emergency stops
- Ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks
- Integration of all components in a full humanoid system

This final module ties together all previous knowledge into complete, intelligent humanoid systems.

## Getting Started

Each module contains hands-on exercises, code examples, and theoretical foundations. The curriculum is designed to be followed sequentially, with each chapter building on the previous ones. All code examples are tested with multiple humanoid platforms and are ready for immediate use.
