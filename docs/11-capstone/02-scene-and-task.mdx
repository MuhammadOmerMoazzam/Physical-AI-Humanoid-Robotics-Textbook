# The Official 2025 Capstone Scene

- 3 × 4 m kitchen (IKEA-style)
- Table with 7 random objects (bottle, apple, trash, tools)
- Trash bin, sink, fridge (opens)
- Human sitting at table (you)

**The 9 steps it must perform autonomously:**

1. Wake up & localize
2. Understand voice command
3. Generate high-level plan
4. Navigate to table
5. Grasp and sort objects
6. Throw trash → bin
7. Open fridge → grasp bottle
8. Bring bottle to human
