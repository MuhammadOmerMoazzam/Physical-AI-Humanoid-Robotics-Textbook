# Capstone Project: Autonomous Conversational Humanoid

**December 2025 — Fully Open, Fully Reproducible**

**Task:** Your humanoid wakes up in a kitchen. You say (natural voice):

> "Good morning. Please tidy the table, throw away the trash, and bring me a fresh water bottle from the fridge."

It understands, plans, walks, manipulates, speaks back, and completes the 9-step task safely.

**Everything you learned in Chapters 00–10 is now live in one pipeline.**
You will run this today.
