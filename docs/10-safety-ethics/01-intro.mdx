# Chapter 10: Safety, Ethics & Human-Robot Interaction

**Learning Objectives**
- Implement ISO/TS 15066–compliant safety in ROS 2
- Design emergency-stop and speed & separation monitoring that actually work
- Understand force-limiting requirements for human–humanoid contact
- Audit your training data for demographic bias
- Navigate the EU AI Act, US Executive Order, and China’s 2025 robotics regulations
- Produce a complete safety case and ethical deployment checklist

> A humanoid that can lift 20 kg and walk 2.5 m/s is legally and morally a heavy machine — treat it as such.
