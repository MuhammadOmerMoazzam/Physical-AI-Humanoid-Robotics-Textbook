# Core Theory That Still Rules in 2025

```mermaid
graph LR
CoM[Center of Mass] --> ZMP[Zero Moment Point]
ZMP --> CP[Capture Point]
CP --> DCM[Divergent Component of Motion]
DCM --> Omega[ω = √(g/z₀)]
```

**Key equations (you must know cold):**
- ZMP = CoMₓ − (CoM̈ₓ / ω²) × (CoM_z − ground)
- ξ = x + ẋ / ω → Capture Point
- ξ̇ = (ξ − ZMP) × ω → DCM dynamics

> If DCM → 0 → robot is capturable (can stop without falling)
