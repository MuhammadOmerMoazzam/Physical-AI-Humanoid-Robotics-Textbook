# Chapter 6: Bipedal Locomotion & Whole-Body Control

**Learning Objectives**
- Master the core theory: ZMP, Capture Point, Divergent Component of Motion
- Implement a convex MPC controller that walks at 1.8 m/s on uneven ground
- Train an RL walking policy that recovers from 200 N pushes
- Understand why RAISE (2025) beats every classical controller
- Deploy the exact same controller in Isaac Sim and on real Unitree G1/Figure 02

> By the end, your humanoid will walk blindly over unseen rough terrain — and get back up if pushed.
