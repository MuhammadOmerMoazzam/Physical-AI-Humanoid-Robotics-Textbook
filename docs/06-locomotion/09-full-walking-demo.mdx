# One Command — Walk Forever

```bash
# Option A – Classical MPC (most reliable)
ros2 launch locomotion mpc_walking.launch.py robot:=g1 terrain:=rough

# Option B – RAISE (fastest + most robust)
ros2 launch locomotion raise_walking.launch.py robot:=g1 policy:=robust

# Option C – DreamerV3 (research mode)
python run_dreamer_policy.py --headless=False
```

Watch your humanoid:
- Walk at 2.5 m/s
- Recover from hockey-player-level shoves
- Traverse unseen rubble fields
