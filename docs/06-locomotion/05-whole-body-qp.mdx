# Real-Time QP Solver (400 Hz on Jetson)

```cpp
// Tasks (priority order)
1. CoM velocity tracking (from MPC/RL)
2. Swing foot trajectory (cubic spline)
3. Posture regularization
4. Joint torque limits
5. Friction cone constraints
```

**Open-source solver used in 2025:** `osqp-eigen` + `qpOASES` → 2.1 ms solve time for 36 DoF
