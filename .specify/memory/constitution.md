# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

**Project**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook  
(A book built with Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code)

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
MUST verify all factual claims through primary sources and cross-referencing with established robotics and AI literature. All content must be traceable to reputable sources.

### II. Clarity for Technical Audiences
MUST write with clarity for an academic and technical audience (students, researchers, and practitioners in AI, robotics, mechanical engineering, and related fields). Content should be accessible at a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 12-14.

### III. Comprehensive Coverage
MUST provide comprehensive coverage of foundational concepts, state-of-the-art methods, and practical applications in physical AI and humanoid robotics. Content must include emerging trends as of December 2025 and beyond.

### IV. Educational Focus
MUST maintain an educational focus with real-world examples, exercises, code snippets, and interactive elements where possible. Each chapter must include learning objectives, key concepts with citations, and end-of-chapter exercises.

### V. Source Verification and Citation Standards
MUST cite sources in IEEE style (numeric references with full bibliography) with minimum 50% peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers (e.g., ICRA, IROS, RSS, Science Robotics, IJRR). The remainder may include authoritative textbooks, technical reports, and credible industry whitepapers.

### VI. Zero Plagiarism Standard
MUST maintain zero tolerance for plagiarism before final deployment. All content must pass plagiarism detection tools such as Turnitin, GPTZero, or Copyleaks.

## Key Standards

### Technical Implementation
- Format: Static website built with Docusaurus, deployed via GitHub Pages
- Tool usage: Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven development and repository structure; Claude Code for generating verifiable code examples, diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML), and simulation snippets
- All code examples must execute correctly and be licensed openly (MIT or Apache 2.0)

### Content Structure
- Minimum 10 chapters as outlined in the project specification
- Each chapter must include: Learning objectives, Key concepts with citations, Code examples (Python/ROS2 where applicable), Diagrams and illustrations, End-of-chapter exercises or discussion questions
- Interactive elements: CodeSandbox/Colab links, embedded Mermaid diagrams, and links to open-source simulators when relevant

## Constraints

### Repository Structure
- Repository must follow Spec-Kit Plus template structure with specifications as first-class artifacts
- Content must be organized to enable modular development and review

### Quality Gates
- 100% of technical claims must be verified against cited sources
- All content must pass plagiarism checks before deployment
- Successful deployment to GitHub Pages with full functionality (search, dark mode, responsive design, fast loading)

### Compliance Requirements
- Full alignment with Spec-Kit Plus workflow: every piece of content traceable to an approved specification
- Positive internal review for educational value, depth, and completeness

## Success Criteria

### Content Quality
- 100% of technical claims verified against cited sources
- Zero plagiarism detected on final content

### Technical Performance
- Successful deployment to GitHub Pages with full functionality (search, dark mode, responsive design, fast loading)
- All code examples execute correctly and are licensed openly (MIT or Apache 2.0)

### Educational Impact
- Positive internal review for educational value, depth, and completeness
- Full alignment with Spec-Kit Plus workflow: every piece of content traceable to an approved specification

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for this project. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan.

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear educational or technical rationale.
