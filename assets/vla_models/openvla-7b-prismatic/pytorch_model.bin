# This is a placeholder file representing the structure of the model
# In reality, this would be a large binary file containing the actual neural network weights

# Model: OpenVLA-7B Prismatic
# Architecture: Vision-Language-Action Transformer
# Parameters: 7 Billion
# Input: RGB Image + Natural Language Command
# Output: Action Vector (Continuous Control Signals)
