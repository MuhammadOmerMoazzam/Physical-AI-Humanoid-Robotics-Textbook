# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**The Definitive Open Textbook (2025 Edition)**

This repository contains the complete Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook – an open, comprehensive guide to building and deploying humanoid robots using only open tools, models, and hardware.

## Overview

This textbook covers everything from foundational setup to autonomous conversational humanoids:
- **Module 1**: Foundations & Infrastructure (Chapters 00-03) – Setup, theory, ROS 2, robot modeling
- **Module 2**: Simulation & Perception (Chapters 04-05) – Physics simulation, perception systems
- **Module 3**: Locomotion & Dexterous Manipulation (Chapters 06-07) – Walking, control, manipulation
- **Module 4**: Intelligence, Transfer & Responsibility (Chapters 08-11) – VLA models, sim-to-real, safety, capstone

## Features

- Complete Docusaurus-based documentation site with interactive elements
- Executable ROS 2 examples that work in simulation and on real hardware
- Integration with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab for state-of-the-art simulation
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for natural language interaction
- Domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer
- Full safety and ethics guidelines for humanoid deployment
- 100% reproducible development environment via DevContainer
