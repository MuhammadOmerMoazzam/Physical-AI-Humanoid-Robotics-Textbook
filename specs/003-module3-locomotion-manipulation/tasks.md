**Feature**: Module 3: Locomotion & Dexterous Manipulation (Chapters 06-07)
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Status**: Complete (all tasks marked as completed in main tasks.md)
**Plan**: [Link to plan.md]

## Summary

This document consolidates the implementation tasks for Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, focusing on locomotion and manipulation for humanoid robots in Chapters 06-07. All tasks have been completed as part of the main project-wide tasks document.

The Module 3 content covers:

- Bipedal locomotion: ZMP theory, Capture Point, DCM, MPC controllers
- Modern RL approaches for walking (RAISE, DreamerV3)
- Whole-body QP control for integrated locomotion and manipulation
- RAISE controller implementation and optimization
- Dexterous manipulation techniques
- Hand kinematics and contact modeling
- Isaac Lab manipulation environments
- Diffusion policies and grasp synthesis

**Status**: All Module 3 tasks completed as part of the main project implementation.
