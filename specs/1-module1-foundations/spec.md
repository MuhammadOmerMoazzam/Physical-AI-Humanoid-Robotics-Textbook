Which of the three data engines will be the biggest bottleneck by 2030? 2. Will specialized robots (arms, quadrupeds) outcompete humanoids in certain industries? 3. Is the humanoid form factor a local maximum or the global optimum? 4. Should we regulate general-purpose humanoids the same way we regulate LLMs? 5. Name one technical capability you believe is still 5+ years away. ### References (IEEE style – full list in master bibliography) [1] H. Moravec, *Mind Children*. Cambridge, MA, USA: Harvard Univ.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Student Learns Physical AI Fundamentals (Priority: P1)

As a beginner to intermediate robotics student/practitioner who needs a zero-friction start to Physical AI, I want to access Module 1: Foundations & Infrastructure that covers Chapters 00–03, with clear setup guides, theoretical foundations, ROS 2 middleware, and humanoid modeling so that I can spin up a reproducible environment and build a basic kinematic model before diving into simulation and perception in Module 2.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational module that enables all subsequent learning in the textbook. Students need to establish their development environment and core understanding before they can proceed.

**Independent Test**: The user can successfully complete Chapter 00 (Setup & Development Environment) and have a complete, working dev environment in under 20 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a robotics student with basic Python, Linux, and linear algebra knowledge, **When** I follow Chapter 00 instructions, **Then** I can launch Isaac Sim + ROS 2 + MoveIt in under 20 minutes
2. **Given** I am following the textbook, **When** I complete Chapter 01 on foundations, **Then** I can explain the 2025 humanoid inflection point with citations
3. **Given** I am working through Chapter 03, **When** I build and plan with a 36-DoF URDF, **Then** I can do so in RViz2 with collision awareness
4. **Given** I am using the textbook's devcontainer, **When** I execute code examples, **Then** all code executes without modification

---

### User Story 2 - Practitioner Reviews 2025 Robotics Foundations (Priority: P2)

As a robotics practitioner who needs to understand the state of the field by 2025, I want to access chapters that explain why embodiment flipped AI in 2024–2025 and provide ROS 2 mastery for 30+ DoF systems with URDF/SRDF/MoveIt 2 knowledge so that I can understand the latest developments relevant to real humanoids.

**Why this priority**: Practitioners need to keep current with the rapidly evolving field of humanoid robotics to remain competitive and make informed decisions.

**Independent Test**: The user can demonstrate ROS 2 Iron mastery for 30+ DoF systems after completing Chapter 02.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a robotics practitioner reviewing the material, **When** I study the three data engines that unlocked humanoids, **Then** I can articulate how they apply to my work
2. **Given** I am working with 30+ DoF systems, **When** I reference the ROS 2 content, **Then** I can apply the 2025 best practices
3. **Given** I need to model humanoids, **When** I use the URDF/SRDF/MoveIt 2 guidance, **Then** I can create models for real humanoids

### User Story 3 - Instructor Teaches Humanoid Robotics (Priority: P3)

As an instructor teaching humanoid robotics, I want to access complete MDX files for Chapters 00–03 with supporting code/assets and _category_.json files so that I can structure my course with reproducible examples and foundational content.

**Why this priority**: Instructors are important stakeholders who will use this textbook to educate the next generation of roboticists.

**Independent Test**: The instructor can successfully use the complete MDX files and supporting assets to teach humanoid robotics concepts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am teaching a course using this material, **When** I present the hardware requirements, **Then** students can follow the 2025 edition guidelines to properly set up their systems
2. **Given** I am teaching ROS 2 concepts, **When** I use the provided examples, **Then** I can demonstrate the core concepts with 30+ DoF humanoids
3. **Given** I am teaching modeling techniques, **When** I use the URDF content, **Then** students can build 36-DoF floating-base humanoid models that work in simulation and reality
